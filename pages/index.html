                <p>Aquacycle is an innovative startup that collects used batteries to turn them into low-cost irrigators, benefiting small farmers and underprivileged communities. With a focus on sustainability, our proposal not only reduces waste, but also offers efficient solutions for water use, promoting more sustainable agriculture.</p><br>
                <p>As well as addressing environmental issues, Aquacycle is committed to encouraging food diversity.
